# Monte-Carlo-simulation-to-show-convergence-of-an-RV
A Monte Carlo simulation can be employed to illustrate the convergence of a random variable (RV). 
This simulation offers a solution to problem 7-14 presented in the book "Fundamentals of Statistical Signal Processing: Estimation Theory" by Steven M. Kay.
